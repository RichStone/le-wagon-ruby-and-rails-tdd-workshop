# Le Wagon Ruby and Rails TDD Workshop

This is here to make you a special bootcamp student: A workshop to dip your feet
into the world of testing and TDD. Enjoy it!

> "TDD will change your life, Rich!"
- Philipp Goebel, 2017

Thanks Philipp, it certainly did!

## Prerequisites

* Ruby installed

* Rails

The workshop starts with pure Ruby and ends with a Rails exercise. It shouldn't
really matter which versions you have installed, the features we'll be using are
standard across the latest versions.

## Installation

```shell
$ git clone git@github.com:RichStone/le-wagon-ruby-and-rails-tdd-workshop.git
$ cd le-wagon-ruby-and-rails-tdd-workshop
$ code . # Or open with Your favorite editor.
```

## Usage

Start with the `exercise_01.md` inside of `exercise_01/`. You'll be guided from
there.

You'll write code and execute it inside each exercise folder's `start/` folder.

Every exercise looks like this:

1. Train TDD and testing step by step
1. Do stuff on your own
1. Do some advanced less guided stuff ("Bonus" tasks)

If you get stuck in one exercise, no worries! They build upon each other but can
be done in isolation. You can go to the next one if you feel that you make no
more progress at all.

If you are curious afterwards, most exercise tasks have a solution in the
exercise's `final/` folder.

## Why are you here?

* Testing and TDD is a powerful USP early in your career

* You get less stuck because now coding becomes more of a structured process

* Your code becomes more reliable and more readable because you think of the
  error and edge cases **before** you write the actual code

* Once a big chunk of your is tested, refactoring becomes an enjoyable process
  instead of a fearful event where all of your code breaks down

## Contribute

this workshop better, please let me know!
