# Le Wagon TDD Workshop

> "TDD will change your life, Rich!"
- Philipp Goebel, 2017

## Why

* Testing and TDD is a powerful USP early in your career

* You get less stuck because now coding becomes more of a structured process

* Your code becomes more reliable and more readable because you think of the
  error and edge cases **before** you write the actual code

* Once a big chunk of your is tested, refactoring becomes an enjoyable process
  instead of a fearful event where all of your code breaks down

## Prerequisites

* Ruby installed

* Rails installed

The workshop starts with pure Ruby and ends with a Rails exercise. Shouldn't
really matter which versions you have installed, the features we'll be using are
standard across the latest versions.
