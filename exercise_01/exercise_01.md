# Hello TDD

Our organization would like to do more testing and TDD again. Today we'll lay
the ground to create a Slack chatbot and other reminder mechanisms to keep our
engineers reminded about the power of TDD.

## Exercise 1: Understand your tools first

We'll work with minitest later. But let's see real quick first, how minitest
works under the hood by building our own test framework ðŸ’ª

**Requirement**

> You are tired by the ugly minitest syntax and the too complex RSpec setup.
You've decided to create your very own testing framework ðŸ’ª You start very
simple with the most important test framework method: One that tests if an
expected input is equal to an actual output.

**Let's try it!**

Create a test framework class and add a method to test for equality. Let's call
our test framework `Check` and the method to test for equality `is_equal?`.

_Step by step..._

- [ ] Create a class `Check` inside of `exercise/start/check.rb`

- [ ] Add an `is_equal?` method to it

- [ ] Create a `check_test.rb` file to test our test framework

- [ ] Add a class in `check_test.rb` that inherits from our `Check` framework
   (don't forget to `require_relative "check` to add your test code to
   `check_test.rb`)

- [ ] Write a test which checks that 1 is equal 1 and `nil` is not equal to
   `false` (the former should visibly pass and the latter should visibly fail)

- [ ] Write code to execute the test methods below your `CheckTest` class

- [ ] Run the test file with `$ ruby check_test.rb` from the command line

**Now you**

What else can you think of that equals something else? And what not? try 1 or 2
more tests on your own.

Cool, now that you know how a testing framework works in its essence, it's time
to get your test-driving license ðŸš—

---

**(Bonus) Gain a deeper understanding of a testing framework**

Create an autorun capability so that when you run your `check_test.rb` all the
tests are run in succession automatically. However, there should be no sign of
the autorun functionality inside of `check_test.rb` everything should happen
inside of `check.rb`.
