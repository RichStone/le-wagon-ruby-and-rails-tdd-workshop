# Hello TDD

Our organization would like to do more testing and TDD again. Today we'll lay
the ground to create a Slack chatbot and other reminder mechanisms to keep our
engineers reminded about the power of TDD.

## Exercise 1: Understand your tools first

We'll work with minitest here. Let's see real quick first, how minitest works
under the hood.

**Requirement**

> Your organization is tired by the ugly minitest syntax and the too complex
RSpec setup. They've decided to create their own testing framework ðŸ’ª Let's
start very simple with the most important test framework method to test for
equality.

**Let's try it!**

Create a test framework class and add a method to test for equality. Let's call
our test framework `Check` and the method to test for equality `is_equal?`.

_Step by step..._

1. Create a class `Check`
1. Add an `is_equal?` method to it
1. Create a `check_test.rb` file to test our test framework
1. Add a class in `check_test.rb` that inherits from our `Check` framework
1. Write a test which checks that 1 is equal 1 and `nil` is not equal to `false`
   (the former should visibly pass and the latter should visibly fail)

**Now you**

What else can you think of that equals something else? And what not? try 1 or 2
more tests on your own.

**Dig deeper homework**

Create an autorun capability so that when you run your `check_test.rb` all the
tests are run in succession automatically. However, there should be no sign of
the autorun functionality inside of `check_test.rb` everything should happen
inside of `check.rb`.
