# Hello TDD

Our organization would like to do more testing and TDD again. Today we'll lay
the ground to create a Slack chatbot and other reminder mechanisms to keep our
engineers reminded about the power of TDD.

## Exercise 1: Understand your tools first

We'll work with minitest here. Let's see real quick first, how minitest works

**Implementation**

1. Create a test framework class and add a method to test for equality. Let's call our test framework `Check` and the method to test for equality `is_equal?`.
